Most handwritten files are expected to stay handwritten indefinitely, although conversion to a generator may be possible for a limited subset of them.
Handwritten resources like google_container_cluster can be identified if they have source code present under the mmv1/third_party/terraform/resources folder or by the absence of the AUTO GENERATED CODE header in their Go source in the downstream repositories.</description></item><item><title>MMv1</title><link>https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/magic-modules/docs/mmv1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/magic-modules/docs/mmv1/</guid><description>MMv1 # Overview # MMv1 is a Ruby-based code generator that implements Terraform Provider Google (TPG) resources from YAML specification files.
MMv1-generated resources like google_compute_address can be identified by looking in their Go source for an AUTO GENERATED CODE header as well as a Type MMv1. MMv1-generated resources should have source code present under their product folders, like mmv1/products/compute for the google_compute_address resource.
